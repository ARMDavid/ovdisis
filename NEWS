980206	Phew, it's been a while. I have made oVDIsis
	compatible with oFBis 0.03 and tested it in
	kernel 2.0.33.

961207	TrueColor support with virtual pens.
	Added v_clrwk and calls it from v_opnwk.

961130	Made the VDI dump program. It's used to compare
	the attributes in oVDIsis and normal VDI/NVDI.

961129	Changed v_opnwk and v_opnvwk to use oFBis-0.02
	new Line-A variables.

961120	Circles, again only solid and hollow, added.
	Last snapshot before remaking since oFBis from
	now on will emulate Line-A, which oVDIsis will
	use in some ways.

961117	Fixed colour handling, but it seems to be linux
	version 2.0.21 that was the problem. No problems
	with 2.0.25.

961112	First versions of v_bar and vr_recfl added. Only
	solid or hollow rectangles supported.

961027	The default GEM palette is set in v_opnwk, so don't
	be afraid by the bright screen you will meet.
	vs_color, vq_color and v_get_pixel is implemented.
	It now needs oFBis-0.01!!

961024	First snapshot, needs oFBis-0.00, not 0.01!
